# Issues backlog

Gaps between the documented ideal state in `docs/` and the repository as it is.
Each entry names its effect and the change that closes it. Remove an entry when
the change lands; do not soften the docs to match the gap.

## Trust: measurements that can mislead a decision

- [ ] **All benchmark captures come from the headless runner.** No GPUI stage is
  measured. The capture backend is `semantic-headless`. Closes with the
  end-to-end runner below.

## Performance findings from the suite

Defects in the platform or host that the benchmark suite has exposed. Each
names the evidence so a fix can be verified against the same case.

- [ ] **Full-root replacement remains superlinear at 100,000 rows.** The
  production 100,000-row sparse-update case confirms the effect after dense
  validation, host-owned child streaming, and consolidation of mounted node
  and parent storage. In a serial same-executable run, 10,000 to 100,000 rows
  grew from 9.47 ms to 139 ms overall. Roc callback work grew 11.4x, validation
  19.0x, and graph apply 20.2x; both lifecycle and measured-span allocated
  bytes grew 10.0x. Further work must preserve the generic tree-integrity
  checks and exact patch counters. The full-root rebuild itself is intentional
  application semantics, with row boundaries providing the local-update
  alternative.
- [ ] **Text and tree-shape families currently measure node count only.** Long
  and short messages at 10,000 rows differ by under 15%, and depth has no
  measurable effect, because the headless path has no layout or paint. These
  families become informative only with the GPUI runner.

## Runner: test what we fly

- [ ] **End-to-end GPUI spec runner.** The driver runs inside the production
  `Application`, opens the real window, resolves a locator to a live node and its
  laid-out bounds, synthesises the input event through GPUI, and closes the cycle
  on the presented frame. Stages that cannot be timed honestly stay
  `unavailable`. GPUI 0.2.2 exposes input injection only through its mock test
  platform, so the driver must capture production prepaint bounds and inject through
  the compositor (Sway's virtual-pointer/seat interface is a viable seam) rather
  than call `Runtime::event_if_live`. The driver must also distinguish laid out
  from actually visible: current large row cases place targets outside the
  window and the platform has no scrolling feature with which to bring them on
  screen.
- [ ] **Layout, paint, and presentation spans** owned by the GPUI side of the
  host. Presentation may need a Wayland frame callback.
- [ ] **CI compositor.** Benchmark jobs run the real Wayland backend under a
  headless compositor such as sway or cage. For Sway this requires a headless
  wlroots output, software rendering on workers without a GPU, and pointer
  movement plus press/release over its IPC or virtual-pointer protocol. The job
  must prove that GPUI receives the real Wayland event before benchmark captures
  are accepted; merely opening a window is insufficient.
- [ ] **Demote the headless runner to smoke.** Remove benchmark policy from it
  and make the scaling and compare views refuse `semantic-headless` captures.

## Input and accessibility

- [ ] **System monitor sensors and charts.** The system-monitor example proves
  bounded live updates, cancellation, and explicit unavailable values. Add
  capability-detected OS CPU and memory samplers, chart/canvas elements,
  process-table sorting and privacy-safe export as complete later slices.

- [ ] **Image decode status is not represented in the mounted graph.** GPUI's
  image asset decoder owns asynchronous success and failure after mounting, but
  does not expose that state to the host element. Add an owner callback that
  records decoded dimensions/frames or a content-free failure category and
  renders a semantic per-image fallback; do not duplicate GPUI's decoder in the
  semantic runner.
- [ ] **Image-library thumbnails and bounded decoded cache.** The foundation
  reads and displays one capability-scoped image. Add background thumbnail
  generation, cancellation/stale-result suppression, viewport-driven grids,
  orientation metadata, and explicit decoded-byte eviction counters before
  scaling to ordinary photo collections.

- [ ] **Textarea selection, IME composition, and clipboard commands.** The
  production textarea accepts ordinary character, Enter, and Backspace input
  and routes complete controlled values through Roc. Close the desktop-editor
  gap with GPUI `EntityInputHandler` selection/marked-text ownership, mouse hit
  testing, copy/cut/paste, and specifications driven through the same route.
- [ ] **Text editing has no clipboard or undo history.** The native text input
  supports focus, caret motion, selection, keyboard deletion, controlled
  updates, submission, and IME composition. Close by routing platform clipboard
  operations and a bounded per-editor undo/redo history through the production
  GPUI input actions, with semantic specifications that never record contents.

- [ ] **HTTP cancellation, streaming, and authority policy.** The bounded
  asynchronous HTTP foundation supports explicit scheme, redirect, timeout,
  header, request-body, and response-body policy, and the workbench suppresses
  stale completions. Add a typed request handle with cooperative transport
  cancellation, bounded streamed upload/download progress, and a grant model
  for restricting network destinations before applications depend on either.

- [ ] **Native accessibility roles and names are not exported.** Buttons,
  checkboxes, and scroll regions have stable semantics in the canonical graph,
  but the GPUI host does not yet publish them to each operating system's
  accessibility API. Close with platform accessibility nodes verified by an
  external accessibility client, while retaining the same semantic names used
  by specifications.
- [ ] **Focus is not restored across replaced subtrees.** Keyboard focus works
  for each live GPUI control, but a Roc state update replaces that control's
  native entity. Dialog open/close is the deliberate exception: its runtime
  policy restores the semantic opener. Close the general gap by carrying role and stable semantic name across a
  successful patch when the corresponding control remains live, and specify
  the destination when navigation removes the focused control.
- [ ] **Composite directory navigation has no roving focus.** A user can reach
  and activate every folder with Tab and Enter or Space. Close with a semantic
  list/list-item element whose Up, Down, Home, and End behavior, selected state,
  scroll-into-view behavior, scaling case, and operating-system accessibility
  mapping all use the production event path.
